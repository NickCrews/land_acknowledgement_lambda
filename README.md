# Land Acknowledgement SMS App
Land Acknowledgement is a simple api that links data about native lands to current locations.  
Designed to run with AWS Lambda and API Gateway 

# Data Sources
This project does two basic things:  
- determines a lat/lon from a city/state
- looks up the native land from that point

Contributions that improve either of these are welcome. Currently the data comes from:

- Data about boundaries of Native land is from: [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca)   
- Geolocations from MapBox
